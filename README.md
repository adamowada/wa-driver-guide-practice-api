# WA Driver Guide Practice API

This repository contains the backend API for an application designed to help native Chinese speakers study the Washington Driver Guide for their knowledge test required to obtain a driver's license. The API leverages GPT-4 by OpenAI to generate questions based on the Washington Driver Guide.

The API is built using the FastAPI framework, which is known for its performance and ease of use. It also uses Turso as the database solution and asyncio for asynchronous database operations.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Used for generating questions based on the Washington Driver Guide.
- **Turso**: Utilized as the database solution for storing questions and answers.
- **asyncio**: For asynchronous operations to handle database transactions efficiently.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform for serverless applications.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and other configurations:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
TURSO_DB_URL=<your_turso_db_url>
TURSO_DB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_turso_db_auth_token>
```

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of two main tables: `questions` and `answers`.

### Questions Table

|---------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| `id`          | INTEGER | Primary key, auto-incremented         |
| `question_id` | INTEGER | Foreign key referencing `questions.id`|
| `answer_text` | TEXT    | The text of the answer                |
| `is_correct`  | BOOLEAN | Indicates if the answer is correct    |
